## Known Limitations
* For error handling, once the pop-up is shown, the app does not go back to the main activity on its own. Going back to the main activity after the pop up appears or crashing the app could be a better solution/more graceful way to handle errors.
* Every time the orientation changes on the Error Handling pop-up, it displays the pop-up view again.
